abstract = "This paper, describes a LQG and LQR robust controller for the lateral and longitudinal flight dynamics of an aircraft control system. The controller is used in order to achieve robust stability and good dynamic performance against the variation of aircraft parameters. The application of the proposed LQG and LQR robust control scheme is implemented through the simulation. The proposed robust controller for aircraft stability is designed using Matlab/Simulink program. Simulation results confirm the performance of the proposed controller for aircraft control system. Since the time of its introduction, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. For example, to determine the velocity of an aircraft or sideslip angle, one could use a Doppler radar, the velocity indications of an inertial navigation system, or the relative wind information in the air data system. Rather than ignore any of these outputs, a Kalman filter could be built to combine all of this data and knowledge of the various systems dynamics to generate an overall best estimate of pitch, roll and sideslip angle."
